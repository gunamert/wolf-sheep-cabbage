The main goal in this code solve the sheep wolf problem as a simple artificial intelligence.
First, we defined the rules. The rules are sheep and wolf cannot be together and sheep and cabbage cannot be together. 
Then we create a starting node which is all the items in the left side. 
Then made a function for control the child creation for root. 
Then made a function for create the child. 
Then create a function for boat action going left or right. 
Last, made a function for reach the goal. Function works recursively. When the code find the shortest path print the route.
